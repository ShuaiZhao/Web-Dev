The difference between class and id:
	You can only have single id per page
	But you have multiple class per page


H1 is the biggest headline, h2, h3.... are getting smaller

<span> </span>
	notes: A span tag is basically just a container, or what's called &quot;an inline element.&quot; Later when we're styling this with our CSS, we're going to want to select just this part of the text. In order to do that, we need to wrap an HTML element around it, so that we can identify it and separate it from the rest of the text. However, we don't want that HTML element to be what's called a block-level element, which would actually push other content down the page. Instead, we want this HTML element to be basically invisible and be in line with the rest of the text. 

<br> To next line. <p> </p> will create a second paragraphe

<a href=""> <img src="" alt=""> </a>  create a hyper link for a image
